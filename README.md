Install dependencies with 
``
pip install -r requirements.txt
``

Add a .env file with 
``
GEMINI_API_KEY="{your key}"
``

Test agent with /src/sar_project/agents/logistic_test.ipynb


Insights:


- I learned that I should expand more on the inner workings on my agent so it can be understood by others when using my 
- I should also error check and make sure my agent'llm is robust enough to handle edge cases and errors since llms make mistakes and it can break the agent
- I should also utilize state of the agents to make it more efficient.

Modifications:

- I added more error checking and make sure my agent is robust enough to handle edge cases and errors
- I made sure the docs were more clear and concise
- added comprehensive testing to logistic_es
